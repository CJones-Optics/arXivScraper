I am a researcher in Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC), specifically with space assets, 
e.g. satellites and spacecraft

I am intersted in Adaptive Optics, Wavefront Sensing and Wavefront Control / Correction. I am also interested
in photonic solutions for FSOC and astronomy (astrophotonics). Finally I am intersted in photonic lanterns.
